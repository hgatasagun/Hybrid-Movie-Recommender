MovieLens is a film recommendation service that offers personalized movie suggestions to its users. The dataset provided by MovieLens comprises 2,000,263 ratings for 27,278 distinct films. It was generated on October 17, 2016, and encompasses data collected from 138,493 unique users. The data covers movie preferences from January 9, 1995, to March 31, 2015, providing a comprehensive view of user preferences during this period. Notably, all users in the dataset were randomly selected and have rated a minimum of 20 films, resulting in a robust representation of diverse user tastes and interests.

## Business Problem
The business problem is to build a hybrid movie recommender system using item-based and user-based approaches to provide personalized movie recommendations for users. The goal is to enhance the movie-watching experience for them by suggesting relevant films that align with their individual preferences.
